## Introduction

This first project aims at classifying observations made in one of the sensors of the CERN Particle Accelerator in Geneva. These observations can be of two types: some correspond to Higgs bosons, an elementary physical particle, the others correspond to the background, to other particles of other nature.

The database corresponds to measurements of particle physics properties of Particle Accelerator. We can interpret these data thanks to a classification algorithm.
  
Our understanding of the transversal objectives of the project seems to be structured around several key points: understanding the functioning of the basic machine learning mechanisms: preprocessing of data, visualizations, variables, selection of the best drivers, elaboration of models, selection and evaluation of models and parameters, training on the whole data set and finally predictions on the test data.



## Launching predictions

Use file run.ipynb to launch predictions file.

## Files and functions

helpers.py : importation and exportation of CSV files

preprocessing.ipynb : Vizualisation of data set and understanding important drivers

Implementations.py : Basic machine learning functions from the course and other function such as confusion matrix, accuracy computation, opening X_train and X_test data files.


## Problems 

We didn't manage to put the data files into the git repository, even zipped they were to big (>25MB), so you need to add your local path to these files into run.ipynb and project_1.ipynb.
