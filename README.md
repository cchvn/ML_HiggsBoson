## Introduction

This first project aims at classifying observations made in one of the sensors of the CERN Particle Accelerator in Geneva. These observations can be of two types: some correspond to Higgs bosons, an elementary physical particle, the others correspond to the background, to other particles of other nature.

The database corresponds to measurements of particle physics properties of Particle Accelerator. We can interpret these data thanks to a classification algorithm.
  
Our understanding of the transversal objectives of the project seems to be structured around several key points: understanding the functioning of the basic machine learning mechanisms: preprocessing of data, visualizations, variables, selection of the best drivers, elaboration of models, selection and evaluation of models and parameters, training on the whole data set and finally predictions on the test data.
